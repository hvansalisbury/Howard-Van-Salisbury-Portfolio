# Howard-Van-Salisbury-Portfolio

## Description

In order to show my coding abilities, I've created an online portfolio that contains past work. I wish to share my portfolio with perspective employers so that they can see what I am capable of. The page itself also showcases much of the HTML and CSS i've learned in bootcamp as well as using Github to deploy my sites.
